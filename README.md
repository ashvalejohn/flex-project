# Project Proposal
PokeLog is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows hemophilia patients to log and review their bleeds and infusions while on or offline. PokeLog's design is device-agnostic, so users have a consistent experience on desktop and mobile. In addition, users can save the web app to their smartphone home screen to mimic a native app experience. Users can set their infusion schedule and PokeLog will remind them to infuse. As a bonus feature, users can choose to share their bleeds and infusions with interested parties (i.e. parents, doctors, etc.). 

PokeLog is built for hemophilia patients to consolidate infusion and bleed information.
