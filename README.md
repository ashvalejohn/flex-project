# Project Proposal

- Link to live demo and/or instructions on how to use and run code -

## Project description
*Hemophilia App* is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows hemophilia patients to log and review their bleeds and infusions while on or offline. *Hemophilia App*'s design is device-agnostic, so users have a consistent experience on desktop and mobile. In addition, users can save the web app to their smartphone home screen to mimic a native app experience. Users can choose to share their bleeds and infusions with interested parties (i.e. parents, doctors, etc.). Users can set their infusion schedule and *Hemophilia App* will remind them to infuse.

*Hemophilia App* is built for hemophilia patients to consolidate infusion and bleed information.

## Functionality & MVP
Users will be able to:
- [ ] Log in/Log out
- [ ] Schedule a reminder to infuse
- [ ] Log an infusion (including date, dose, and whether it was in response to a bleed)
- [ ] See a calendar view of infusions and bleeds
- [ ] Notify interested parties of an infusion

## Stack
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- Sequelize (?)
- Express.js (?)
- React/Redux

## Implementation Details
### (basically anything you had to stop and think about before building)
- Progressive Web App (Service Workers)
- JSON Web Tokens (Auth)
- Responsive Web Design
- **Socket.io**: to alert shared users after an infusion or bleed

## Code Snippets
Include links to the neatest parts of the code, or embed snippets

## Screenshots
Include screenshots of anything that looks pretty

## To Dos
### Weekend 1
- Objective: All members will use the weekend to familiarize themselves with the new elements of the stack (Node.js, Express, PWA, JSON Web Tokens). 
- Goals:
  - [ ] completed Project Proposal
  - [ ] understanding of stack
  - [ ] JWT user authentication
  
### Phase One: Login & Infusion Log
- [ ] User can create account
- [ ] User can log into account
- [ ] User can create an infusion
- [ ] User can update an infusion

#### Monday
- Objective: Users should be able to login
