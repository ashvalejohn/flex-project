# Project Proposal

- Link to live demo and/or instructions on how to use and run code -

## Project description
*Hemophilia App* is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows hemophilia patients to log and review their bleeds and infusions while on or offline. *Hemophilia App*'s design is device-agnostic, so users have a consistent experience on desktop and mobile. In addition, users can save the web app to their smartphone home screen to mimic a native app experience. Users can choose to share their bleeds and infusions with interested parties (i.e. parents, doctors, etc.). Users can set their infusion schedule and *Hemophilia App* will remind them to infuse.

*Hemophilia App* is built for hemophilia patients to consolidate infusion and bleed information.

## Functionality & MVP
- [ ] Hosted on Heroku
- [ ] Can save to home screen
Users will be able to:
- [ ] Log in/Log out
- [ ] Schedule a reminder to infuse
- [ ] Log an infusion (including date, dose, and whether it was in response to a bleed)
- [ ] See a calendar view of infusions

### Bonus Features
- [ ] See a heatmap view of bleeds
- [ ] Notify interested parties of an infusion

## Stack
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- Sequelize (?)
- Express.js (?)
- React/Redux

## Implementation Details
- Progressive Web App (Service Workers)
- **JSON Web Tokens**: user authentication
- Responsive Web Design
- **Socket.io**: to alert shared users after an infusion or bleed

## To Dos
